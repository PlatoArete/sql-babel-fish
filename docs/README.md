# Documentation Index

- Extractor internals (annotated): `extract_teradata_dependencies.md`
- Project goals and scope: `../agents/AGENTS.md`

Notes
- If the `agents/AGENTS.md` path is not visible in your checkout (e.g., ignored in some clones), the key content is summarized in the root `README.md` and in the annotated extractor doc above.
